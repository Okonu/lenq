//TODO:
so, documents can belong to a case, i.e inside the case interface one can upload a document, but they can also, analyse/review the document via button, this then send to AI for that, also, inside that interface we can have the chat, but this one will take the case and dateTime as the title of the conversation automatically, such that now inside the case when they click start chat/conversation we will just be showing them the create chat part, and here also, also they can add a document, but that doesnt mean we take them back to the document route, and they dont have to select the type of document, we can take a default type but give them still the option to select in the dropdown, so if a document is attached to the chat or any chat, we just dont redirect them to the document page for them to upload or even view the result of the analysis, so, we will now be using reusable components for that, heavily for that, the aim is to make the UX super and intuitive
